  <h2>Competitions and Projects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Physics Olympics 2018</b> <br>
    https://njaapt.wildapricot.org/<br>
    Rank: 4/50 (January 2018)
      <ul>
        <li>Used knowledge in physics to answer challenging “Fermi” questions,
          in which competitors had to make accurate estimations within a certain
           order of magnitude</li>
        <li>Worked as a team to design a “coffee can racer”. The competition was
           to have the coffee can roll slowest down a ramp. We accomplished this
            through our knowledge in physics</li>
        <li>Created an aerodynamic spring race car using physics knowledge</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> <b>IEEE Robotics Competition 2016</b> <br>
    http://sites.ieee.org/njcoast/ <br>
    Rank: 2/54 (April 2016)
      <ul>
        <li>Created a working robot out of a wood slab, a motor, and various
          other parts following a set of instructions with some room for
          improvisation</li>
        <li>Using a remote controller, the robot was maneuvered around various
          obstacles in a course. The team with the fastest time wins.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> <b>VEX EDR Kit</b> <br>
      https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexedr
      <ul>
        <li>Learned to assemble a robot from a kit with instructions provided,
          then modified the robot to better suit a competition. Our school has
          not yet competed.</li>
        <li>Used the ROBOTC programming language to automate the robot to move
          to pick up cones for the competition</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> <b>Raspberry Pi Arcade Machine</b> <br>
    https://www.raspberrypi.org/
      <ul>
        <li>Currently working on creating a 2-player arcade machine with a
          Raspberry Pi</li>
        <li>Designing a layout using AutoDesk to create wood cutouts of the
          machine’s box</li>
        <li>Programmed an emulator into the Raspberry Pi and connected it to
          buttons, a joystick, and monitor</li>
